   <p><pre>    Death and silence are needed to embody the human's incertitude.
    Highlighting the contrast is highlighting the subject itself. 
        Highlighting death is to present life.
    
    When we are born, the cry is a sign of life, 
    the scream as a vocal element connected directly to the existence of the mouth
    the mouth is a symbol of life. 
               abolishing it
                        a way to call death.
                        
    Silence and speech are in a constant rhythm:
                        Music silence
                        Music silence
                        Music silence, etc. 
    Languages descend from that rhythm:
                        Word space
                        Word space
                        Word space, etc. 
    
    If we rebel against the rhythm, it means we create a parallel act or a parallel world.
    
    When a body is stateless, it will intentionally float above oceans water, 
    Facing silence as the last trip that signifies the act of choosing a parallel path.
